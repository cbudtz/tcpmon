# TCPMon+

TCPMon+ is a utility for viewing HTTP requests and responses. It is based on Robert Bachmans fork from Apache's [TCPMon 1.0](http://ws.apache.org/tcpmon/).

See <http://robertbachmann.github.io/tcpmon/> for a tutorial.

## Change log  

### TCPMon+ 1.1.0
Now loads settings from customPorts.json when you click on Load - will add FileSelector later (perhaps)
